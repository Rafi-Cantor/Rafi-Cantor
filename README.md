I'm a full-stack developer specializing in building engaging front ends with React.js and TypeScript and using Python (Flask) to develop backend systems. I have hands-on experience with AWS services such as Lambda, S3, Amplify, CloudWatch, Cognito, and more. Additionally, I'm skilled in MUI (Material UI), PostgreSQL, GitHub Actions, and Git/GitHub. I've worked in both agency and startup environments, delivering quality solutions across a multitude of projects.
